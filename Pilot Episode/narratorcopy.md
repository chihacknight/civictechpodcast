# Intro

This is 'Dots On A Map'
I'm Eric Sherman
I want you to think about government, and what that word means to you
As a society, we've established certain rules and polices that are designed to make us safer, more equal, and generally a better group of people to live with
But, To most people I know, the word 'government' conjures up images of waiting in line and trying to follow the rules of arcane and confusing processes

Most of us go about our daily lives without having to interact with government institutions, but when we do finally have to go to the DMV, or file our taxes, or pay a parking ticket, its not often a smooth and pleasent experience

And then there are the moments in life when you need help the most. Applying for food stamps, or maybe even for unemployment 

Chris

We'll hear more about Code for America and Chi Hack Night in a bit, and you'll be hearing alot of voices that were recorded at Chi Hack Night , 

but before Chris started working for Code for America, before Chi Hack Night even existed, he experienced firsthand just how hard it could be to do a great job in government working with the tools provided to public servants.

Derek, why dosen't government have the best

This is a big question, and not one that be answered or solved overnight. In fact, its actually an issue people have been working on for the past several years which has evolved into what is often called the civic tech movment. I reached out to juan pablo velez, who helped start Chi Hack Night along with Derek and Christopher, in order to explore a bit of the history of this movement.

George Pissed off optmists

So Lets quickly go back about four years ago, when the civic tech in Chicago was first starting to build. 

Juan BG, Chris spin-off



Chi Hack Night is a free, weekly event in Chicago to build, share and learn about tools to create, support, and serve the public good. The group started in 2012

Ok, so, thats how Chi Hack Night started, but what is Chi Hack Night today? has grown from a handful of people to a typical attendence of about 120 every Tuesday at 6pm.  
On Apr 12, 2016, Chi Hack Night celebrated their 200th event. 

We meet in the Braintree office on the 8th floor of the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago. The event is free, and the invitation is open to anyone, especially folks who arenâ€™t programmers. 

Collectivley, it is a group of thousands of designers, academic researchers, data journalists, activists, policy wonks, web developers and curious citizens who want to make their city more just, equitable, transparent and delightful to live in through data, design and technology.

Food is provided, there is open floor for introductions and announcements, presentations, as well as educational and working groups.

But the civic tech movment dosen't just affect people who work with government, it also offers an important social counter-weight.
