# What is this about?

I (Eric Sherman), have decided to create a well produced and interesting podcast that tells stories about civic technology, as a movement and as a description for how people use technology to engage with other people.

## How can I help?

Areas of strength that I would be able to contribute to: planning/producing, recording and editing the audio for the podcast.

### Be a Host!

Do you happen to have experience interviewing people? Are you comfortable on a microphone, charismatic, or in possession of a voice that makes people think you are?

I'm very open to the idea of having either a co-host or someone else host the podcast entirely. I may even have _no_ host, depending on how the content is edited together.


### Help with the things I know nothing about!


* Marketing
* Branding
* Publishing

Things I absolutely want input from those more 'in the know': best ways to structure the podcast, developing a better idea of the potential audience, awareness of where the content might best fit with content already generated by Chi Hack Night and the civic tech community at large.

### Submit an issue!

Have an idea for a great name for the podcast?

Content for an episode?

Answers to questions about positioning and branding?

Please feel free to submit an issue. I want the production process and brain-storming to be as bottom-up and transparent as possible. After all, this is a podcast about civic tech, it can itself serve as an example of civic tech.
